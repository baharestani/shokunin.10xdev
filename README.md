# August Challenge: Find the 10x Developer
A solution to ThoughtWorks Australia shokunin coding challenge

## Background
Jessie, Evan, John, Sarah and Matt are all engineers in the same delivery team (note: any resemblance to actual TWers, living or dead, is purely coincidental)... and each of them has a different level of coding skill to the other.  This means it possible to order them from best to... "least best".  Importantly, the best of them is the mythical 10x Developer!!!

## Here's what we know
- Jessie is not the best developer
- Evan is not the worst developer
- John is not the best developer or the worst developer
- Sarah is a better developer than Evan
- Matt is not directly below or above John as a developer
- John is not directly below or above Evan as a developer

## Challenge
You need to write a solution to compute these answers:
1. Who is the 10x developer on the team?
1. What is the correct ordering of the members of the team according to their coding skills?

## Prerequisite

.NET Core 2.2 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
